- [HEK](https://www.hek.ch) announces [a new exhibition](https://www.hek.ch/en/program/exhibitions/anne-duk-hee-jordan/) from a German-Korean Anne Duk Hee Jordan, with the title **_I must alter myself into a life-form which can exist on this planet_**.

> She translates the complex ecological problems of our time into visually experienceable, pleasurable worlds and does so with a tongue-in-cheek humour that makes new perspectives and approaches to solutions possible.

- There is a forthcoming book _**Christa Sommerer & Laurent Mignonneau: The Artwork as a Living System**_ and the related book presentaion was held. ZKM also held an exhibition with the artists and [an uploaded interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFEZx-hU4Wg) via [art electronica](https://ars.electronica.art/planetb/en/the-artwork-as-a-living-system/)
